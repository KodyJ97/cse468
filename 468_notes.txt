Notes on command line for executing pthreads.
Execute the pthreads programs by using
gcc multithread_p1.c -o mp1 -lpthread

Notes on matrix.c
Currently unable to run 1024 size for matrix.c due to a segmentation fault (core dumped) error.
Don't think I can run it on my vm but works for 128, 256, and 512. Therefore safe to assume it
may work for 1024.
